<p>There's a lot of code I've written over the years.  Some of it is even useful!  This is a list of some of the more notable endeavors.</p>

<h2>Help!!</h2>
<p>Problems?  Come harass us on IRC: <a href="irc://irc.veekun.com/veekun">irc.veekun.com #veekun</a>.</p>

<h2>Getting code</h2>
<p>All of the code I've written since late 2008 is in <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> repositories, <a href="http://git.veekun.com/">http://git.veekun.com/</a>.</p>

<p>You need to have git installed to get the code.  Linux users can probably get it from their package manager (<var>git-core</var> in the Debian family); OS X and Windows users should get the appropriate installer from the <a href="http://git-scm.com/download">git site</a>.  Then pop open a terminal and do:</p>

<pre>git clone git://git.veekun.com/<var>project</var>.git</pre>

<p>You'll now have a directory named after the project and populated with the current code.  Run <code>git pull</code> from inside it to update.  Look over the <a href="http://git-scm.com/documentation">git documentation</a> if you want to play around further.</p>

<p>If the above doesn't work, or you're super lazy, you can also use any of the "snapshot" links on git.veekun.com.  But this makes it hard to stay up to date or contribute back changes.  So don't do that.</p>

<p>Hey, that's where you are now!</p>

<p>veekun is one of the few projects that uses my new <a href="http://bugs.veekun.com/projects">bug tracker</a>.  Feel free to peruse or <a href="http://bugs.veekun.com/projects/veekun-incoming/issues/new">file bugs</a>.</p>

<p>Likewise, its documentation is on the bug tracker's wiki.  There are a few places to go, depending on what you're looking to do:</p>

<ul class="classic-list">
    <li><a href="http://bugs.veekun.com/projects/veekun/wiki/Documentation">veekun documentation</a>, for running the entire site; only useful if you want to help us work on it or totally rip me off</li>
    <li><a href="http://bugs.veekun.com/projects/pokedex/wiki/GettingData">How to get the Pokédex data</a>, if you want to do something veekun can't or are building your own Pokémon application</li>
    <li><a href="http://bugs.veekun.com/projects/pokedex/wiki/CLI">Pokédex command-line documentation</a>, which is admittedly not very useful</li>
</ul>

<h2>Kouyou</h2>

<p>A little XHTML+SVG color selector.  Rather bare at the moment, but I use it all the time because most applications have HSV instead of HSL/HSB, and the latter is far more intuitive to me.</p>
